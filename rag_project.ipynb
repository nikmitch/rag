    "- Understand embeddings better, and build skills in visualisation to illustrate the distance between different words\n",
    "- Make a basic RAG that can read a larger document and answer basic questions from the text (from a file in .md or .txt format) - following [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcqEUSNCn8I). \n",

When making a RAG, we're first going to create a database by chunking up all the inputs into manageable-sized pieces (with overlap between chunks) and then using particular embeddings to encode the meaning of the chunks as vectors. Once we have that, we can use the same embeddings on the input question, and then retrieve the top few chunks that have the most similar meaning vectors (e.g. smallest euclidean distance apart) and use this subset of data to construct the answer from.\n",

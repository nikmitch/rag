(00:01) listen to this this otherworldly sound happens to be a justin bieber song slowed down 800 percent and it's this contorted version of the song that was responsible in part for inspiring what would eventually become the sound of the batmobile in the latest batman film [Music] this video is sponsored by curiositystream watch the exclusive companion video on nebula when you sign up for the curiosity stream nebula bundle today watch this clip on mute a truck passes in front of the frame and imagine with me for a moment what sound
(00:48) you think will accompany that truck got it okay here it is i must choose my targets carefully instead of a truck we hear a train but there's no visual sign of a train in this shot or any of the shots in close proximity the film establishes trains as part of the setting but when the sound plays we don't see a train the sound of the train passing fades out as the truck passes it's almost as if the truck was making the sound i'm guessing if you've seen the movie you didn't even notice or
(01:19) think about this but this small detail reveals something about sound in film and especially how it's used in the batman that i think is fascinating gotham city in the new batman film is soaked in rain i don't think i've seen a film that uses rain this relentlessly since david fincher's seven which this movie is obviously drawing some inspiration from it's impressive the range of effects and moods that the sound team for the batman manages to get out of the sound of the rain this rain hitting the bat signal at the beginning
(01:48) almost has a sinister sizzling feel the rain in this scene feels cold icy and almost sleet like the rain in a more intimate setting like this one or this one feels warmer and cozier and in this scene where batman's doing some hard-boiled detective investigating the rain in the background almost sounds like boiling or simmering water if you listen closely the rain has a unique sound in almost every scene or location in the film and the differences in the sounds don't just reflect the fact that rain sounds different in
(02:32) different environments they actually design the sound of the rain to reinforce the mood of each scene i've talked before about expressionism and cinematography and similar to how harsh shadows and lighting and even set design can become an external manifestation of a character's internal psychological state sound can express these things as well but the way something sounds isn't the only way you can use sound expressively the mix of the sound its volume and the relative volume of different sound elements in the scene
(03:02) can be used in an expressionistic way take this moment [Music] if you were standing in a room and it was raining outside you could hear the rain and as long as it's still raining in the real world the volume of the rain outside isn't going to change but let's turn down the dialogue in this scene and i want you to listen closely to what's happening with the sound of the rain in the background [Music] [Music] here the rain which is a prominent part of the ambient soundscape softens and almost drops away completely for a
(03:54) moment to emphasize the tension between batman and selena before coming back in towards the end the mix here is modeling the sound of the film around the subjective experience of the characters in the real world when you're focused in on something you tend not to pay attention to the ambient sounds around you they're still there at a constant volume but you're not actually hearing them right now in whatever environment you're watching this in there are probably all kinds of external sounds that you
(04:25) haven't been listening to while you're listening to me but if i draw your attention to them like i'm doing now you probably suddenly become aware of them in our subjective experience of the world what we hear reflects what we're paying attention to so by manipulating the level of certain ambient sounds the sound team is placing you as the viewer inside the character's subjective perspective this kind of subjectivity isn't just created through levels listen to this moment and pay close attention to the
(04:54) sound of the camera flashes he's wearing gloves friday july 16th my life has been a cruel riddle i could not solve hear how they become echoey and reverby as gordon reads the riddler's words in this scene we're inside batman's auditory perspective here the sound design isn't replicating a real world effect in how we perceive sound just like we don't actually see in slow motion but sometimes cinematographers use that to create a subjective effect there's a kind of dissociative quality to this kind of
(05:29) echoey effect that helps us understand the headspace the characters are in in a film sound's relationship to reality can be very loose instead of crafting a soundscape that is realistic sound designers and engineers have a lot of leeway in a film to design sounds that create the right impression of reality or that reflect a character's subjective experience rather than what the environment or the objects would actually sound like [Music] i'm sure we're all familiar with the idea of score using a motif or theme to
(05:59) cue a certain character this film obviously has one for batman that it employs in sometimes strikingly subtle ways like in this moment where it literally only plays the first note of the theme as the words the batman appear on screen we often think of a film soundtrack as coming from a kind of objective perspective where the film itself is telling us what the emotions of the scene are or what's happening but film score can be used subjectively as well in this moment when selena's theme plays as this boot is revealed the film's
(06:30) score isn't telling us objectively that it's selena because it turns out not to be the film is telling us that bruce thinks it's selena my favorite soundtrack cue in the film is the riddler's ave maria which is used expertly for this scene the association between the riddler and the song is established earlier in the film and here the fact that the choir sings it before the riddler shows up gives the whole scene a sense of foreboding and suspense but by placing the music in the scene diegetically
(07:03) which just means that the sound is actually coming from within the world of the film instead of just one that's part of the omniscient soundtrack it creates a sense of ambiguity that pervades the scene the ambiguity doesn't just come from the song we also hear this sound which sounds like the riddler's signature gasp scream thing but then it ends in a cough so we're not quite sure if it's supposed to actually be the riddler or not which is the entire tension of the scene bruce is paranoid and is seeing the riddler
(07:35) everywhere and the film does a great job of helping us enter into that ambiguity and mystery through the sound design one of the interesting auditory tools that this movie uses kind of exists in the space between sound effect and soundtrack listen to this ambient soundscape it's kind of an underwater droning and it crops up pretty much any time riddler is on screen and batman is looking at or listening to him it's not a piece of film score but it's also not really a sound effect it's not motivated
(08:12) by any element of the environment but this sound unlike ave maria also isn't a cue for the riddler it's more of a cue for batman's emotional response to the riddler here that underwater ambience comes in right after falcone is shot giving us an early indication that the batman thinks the riddler is responsible and then it shifts to the ave maria theme as that suspicion is confirmed after the riddler is unmasked and the batman has a confrontation with him the next time we see a video of the riddler
(08:51) that ambient sound bed is absent hey guys thanks for all the comments and uh because the batman's perspective of the riddler has changed i'm honestly kind of in awe of the extensive work and artistry that goes into the sound design on a film like this it takes entire teams of people an incredible amount of work and a lot of thought goes into crafting every part of how a film like this sounds and a lot of the techniques used aren't even intuitive for example why is this scene so impactful the sound of the club just seems so
(09:30) intense and overwhelming well it turns out to make the scene feel the way it does the sound team discovered that they actually needed to make the sound of the punches quieter compare the sound of these hits to these from moments earlier it's a mild difference but in the mix these hits are actually quieter than these here's a modified version of the scene where i brought up the levels of some of these punches it changes the whole feel of the scene when we're watching a film we understand the volume of sounds relative to each
(10:05) other so if the punches in this scene are clearly audible the music feels way quieter if we were in the room and the music was really blaring you wouldn't be able to hear these hits another example of this kind of thing is in this scene where we can clearly hear the rain but then moments later once gunfire breaks out the rain falls away into silence listen to this modified version where the sound of the rain remains audible the gunshots actually sound quieter even though i haven't changed their level all
(10:44) i've done is leave the rain at the volume it was at moments before the key takeaway here is that almost nothing you hear in a film like this is a reflection of reality the sound is almost entirely impressionistic and expressionist the idea is to create a sound that feels right to the audience not one that would be accurate if closely examined because realism isn't the goal you often can't achieve what you want simply by going out into the world and recording real world sounds the batmobile is a great example of this the sound design
(11:28) combines the engine sounds from multiple sources but there's a key ingredient that comes from a curious place that's the sound of a bottle rocket going off supervising sound editor will files liked the sound and wanted to incorporate it into the sound design of the batmobile but it was too short and felt too quick and small it was ultimately the same technique that was used to create this strange ethereal version of this justin bieber song that morphed the bottle rocket sound into the sound of the batmobile
(12:02) that's in the film by stretching the same bottle rocket sound out into different lengths and then layering those together viles and his team were able to build the unique rising scream that helps make the batmobile reveal so impactful [Music] and by modifying a real sound instead of trying to generate it synthetically they maintained a physicality and imperfect quality in the sound that's a better fit for the film and the batmobile's grungy dirty aesthetic subjective perspective plays an incredibly important role in the story
(12:41) of the batman and i've been talking about how that subjectivity is created through sound but it's also developed in cinematography in a way i think is crucial to the story the movie is trying to tell you can see more about how the film develops and uses visual perspective in the companion video i've made exclusively available on nebula nebula is a streaming platform created by and for independent content creators like myself on nebula you can watch every video from me and a ton of other amazing creators early and without any

    "- Learn how to interact with ChatGPT via an API, so I can do more automation and use it in coding projects\n",
    "- Understand environments better (through the course of debugging all this stuff) -- added post hoc lol - I screwed up my base conda installation when I was trying to follow one of the videos at the start of this process\n",
    "- Understand embeddings better, and build skills in visualisation to illustrate the distance between different words\n",
    "- Make a basic RAG that can read a larger document and answer basic questions from the text (from a file in .md or .txt format) - following [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcqEUSNCn8I). \n",
    " - Tried out both openai embeddings and ollama embeddings \n",
    "    - <span style=\"color:red\">Got negative similarity scores when doing a retrieval search from the database with ollama embeddings, which shouldn't be a thing (Should be between zero and 1)!. I found this [git issue](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/issues/10864) logged on the langchain github with people mentioning this issue with a bunch of models (including 1 or 2 talking about getting the issue with locall llama in the last week). It does not yet appear to be resolved. Going to stick with OpenAI embeddings for now, and maybe check back in a while and see if anyone has a solution.</span>\n",

When making a RAG, we're first going to create a database by chunking up all the inputs into manageable-sized pieces (with overlap between chunks) and then using particular embeddings to encode the meaning of the chunks as vectors. Once we have that, we can use the same embeddings on the input question, and then retrieve the top few chunks that have the most similar meaning vectors (e.g. smallest euclidean distance apart) and use this subset of data to construct the answer from.\n",

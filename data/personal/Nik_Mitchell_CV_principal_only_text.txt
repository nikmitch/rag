NZ Royal Commission Inquiry - COVID-19 Lessons Learned (Wellington, NZ)

Principal Data Analyst (May 2024 -- July 2024)
Created high-quality visualisations to support the Inquiry.

Created visualisations that contextualised pandemic trends (COVID-19 cases, hospitalisations, deaths and vaccinations) in 
New Zealand against policy decisions (e.g. lockdowns, border closing) and pandemic trends in other countries. Also conducted 
analyses and created visualisations to highlight the disparate impact of COVID-19 on M\a=aori and Pacific ethnic groups and 
people living in areas of higher socioeconomic deprivation. Worked closely with the Chair of the Commission to discuss how 
to tell the story of the COVID pandemic through the above visualisations in a way that draws out lessons for future pandemics.
